                <h1>What tech advice would you say many middle schoolers could use?</h1>

                <p><strong>Mr. Shaker:</strong> Make the most out of the applications you have available. For example, Rocky Hill students have access to great software like Microsoft Office (PowerPoint, Word, etc.) and Adobe products like Photoshop.</p>
                <p><strong>Ms. Mason:</strong> Many middle schoolers could practice more with sending emails to stay in contact with teachers and communicate any needs.</p>
